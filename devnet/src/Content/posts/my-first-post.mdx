# My First Blog Post

Welcome to my **first** blog post! This is written in MDX.

## What I'm Learning

I'm learning how to build a blog with:
- Next.js
- MDX
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

## Code Example

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello World!";
console.log(greeting); ```

##My Thoughts
This is pretty cool! I can write markdown and it becomes a beautiful blog post.
