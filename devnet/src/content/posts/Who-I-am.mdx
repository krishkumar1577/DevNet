# Who I Am

Hey there ðŸ‘‹ â€” I'm **Krish**, and this is **not** your usual introduction.

This post isn't just to tell you about me.  
It's a **declaration**, a **trailer**, and a bit of a **challenge** â€” to myself, and to anyone watching.

##  Where I'm Coming From

I'm a student of **Computer Science** at Chandigarh University, but more than that, I'm obsessed with:

- **Helping other and collabrate with them**
- **Coding things that matter**
- **Turning chaos into systems**
- **Challenging comfort zones â€” daily**

You'll usually find me somewhere between 1 AM coding sprints and 7 AM workouts â€” powered by **curiosity**, **caffeine**, and a refusal to be average.

##  What I'm Building

Right now? This blog.  
But also:

- **Projects** that test my limits
- **Ideas** that turn into side hustles
- A **network** that opens up rooms most people never enter
- **Extensions** that help people easy there productivity

And yeah â€” I'm learning how to build full-stack apps using:
- `Next.js`
- `React.js`
- `Tailwind CSS`
- `MDX`
- `MongoDB` (soonâ„¢)
- With some spicy **GSAP** animations to keep things alive ðŸ”¥

## ðŸ§  Why I'm Doing This

Because it's easy to talk.  
It's harder to **build in public**, to be accountable, and to **stay consistent**.

This blog is my way of saying:
> "I'm not waiting to 'get ready.' I'm already in motion."

##  What You Can Expect Here

- Personal dev logs & stories
- Projects from scratch (failures included)
- Learnings I wish I knew sooner
