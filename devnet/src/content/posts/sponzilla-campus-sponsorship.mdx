# SponZilla ‚Äî The Project I Built Instead of Complaining

Remember that feeling when you see a problem **everywhere** and think *"Someone should fix this"*?

Yeah, that was me watching student clubs at my university send dozens of cold emails, begging for sponsorships.

So I built **SponZilla** ‚Äî a platform where clubs actually find sponsors, and brands actually find students worth sponsoring.

---

## Where It Really Started

Picture this: You're running a robotics club. You've got 200+ members, organizing hackathons, building actual robots. But you're broke.

So you do what everyone does:
- Send 50+ emails to random companies
- Wait weeks for "we'll get back to you" 
- Create the same pitch deck for the 15th time
- Get ignored by 90% of prospects

Meanwhile, brands are literally **paying agencies thousands** to "connect with Gen Z" when there are engaged student communities right there.

**The disconnect was painful to watch.**

---
## üí° What I Built Instead

SponZilla is basically **Tinder for sponsorships** (but actually useful).

Clubs list their events. Brands browse and connect. Everyone wins.

But here's what makes it different from just "another marketplace":

### ü§ñ AI Pitch Deck Generator
One click. Boom. Professional pitch deck.

I got tired of seeing clubs spend hours on PowerPoint when they should be organizing events. So I built an AI that creates compelling presentations automatically.

You input:
- Event details
- Expected attendance  
- Budget needs

You get:
- Professional slides
- Market analysis
- ROI projections
- Brand partnership options

### üìä Smart Analytics (For Both Sides)
**Clubs see:** Which brands are most active, what types of events get funded, success rates by category.

**Brands see:** Audience demographics, engagement metrics, event ROI data.

No more guessing. Just data.

### üéØ Intelligent Matching
Built a simple algorithm that actually works:

```typescript
const matchScore = {
  industryAlignment: checkIndustryMatch(club, brand),
  audienceOverlap: calculateAudienceMatch(club.members, brand.targetDemo),
  budgetCompatibility: compareBudgets(event.cost, brand.sponsorshipRange),
  pastSuccessRate: analyzePreviousPartnerships(brand, club.category)
};
```

---

Translation:
```ts
const sponsorshipFlow = {
  current: ['coldEmail', 'wait', 'followUp', 'silence'],
  emotion: 'tired',
  waste: 'time+energy'
};
```

I wanted: publish ‚Üí discoverable ‚Üí evaluated ‚Üí response ‚Üí track.

---

---

## What I Chose To Build (First)

- Role‚Äëbased auth (club / brand)
- Event listing + lightweight profile credibility
- Application + contact flow
- Basic matching (readable weights)

Then only after that worked: AI pitch deck + simple analytics.

Not building everything at once is the reason this exists.

---

## Feature Snapshots (Human, Not Hype)

üß† AI Pitch Deck ‚Äî Input event basics ‚Üí get a structured narrative. It‚Äôs a *starter*, not magic. Saves ‚Äúblank slide paralysis.‚Äù

üìä Analytics (v1) ‚Äî Top viewed events, category interest, basic interaction counts. Enough signal to feel alive.

üéØ Matching ‚Äî Weighted scoring you can read:
```ts
score = (industry*0.3) + (audience*0.25) + (budget*0.25) + (history*0.2)
```
If it needs a diagram, it‚Äôs too fancy (for now).

---

---

## Tech Stack (Picked for Momentum)

- React + TypeScript ‚Äî Fewer ‚Äúwhat is this?‚Äù moments
- Tailwind CSS ‚Äî Design by composition
- Vite ‚Äî Fast loops = less context switching
- Vercel ‚Äî Deploy ‚Üí test with real people fast

Tiny reusable pattern:
```tsx
function Section<T>({ title, items, render }: { title: string; items: T[]; render: (i: T)=>React.ReactNode }) {
  if (!items.length) return null;
  return <section><h3>{title}</h3><ul>{items.map(render)}</ul></section>;
}
```

---

## Timeline (Condensed)

## Week 1: Research Phase
Talked to 15+ club leaders. Key insights:
- Everyone hates the current process
- Most gave up after 10 rejections
- Success rate was roughly 8%

### Week 2-3: Core Features
Built the MVP:
- Club registration
- Event listing
- Basic brand browsing
- Contact system

### Week 4-5: The Fun Stuff
- AI pitch deck generator
- Analytics dashboard
- Smart matching algorithm
- Mobile-responsive design

### Week 6: Reality Check
User testing revealed people **loved** the AI pitch deck feature but found the matching algorithm too complex.


Simplified. Made it work.

## Real Moments

- First club: ‚ÄúWait, I don‚Äôt have to rebuild the deck?‚Äù
- First brand: ‚ÄúAt least I can *filter* now.‚Äù
- First bug report: wrong role redirect loop at 1:12 AM.

These are the fuel more than numbers.

---

---

## Current Friction (Still There)

- Verification flow is manual
- Matching doesn‚Äôt learn yet
- Deck export could be prettier
- Mobile interaction polish pending

Leaving some edges rough keeps iteration honest.

---

---

## What‚Äôs Next (Pragmatic)

Short term:
- Better filtering
- Payment / commitment signals
- Mobile navigation improvements

Later:
- Learning scoring (not buzzword ML)
- Post‚Äëevent impact summaries
- Region tagging

Maybe:
- Reputation layer (careful before doing this)

Not now:
- Blockchain contracts
- Overdone gamification

---

## Lessons (Sharp + Useful)

- Time saved for users is the real feature

- Cutting scope is a growth hack

Personal: momentum beats motivation 10/10.

---

---

## Code That Mirrors The Build

```ts
const sponzilla: Project = {
  name: 'SponZilla',
  builtBy: 'Krish',
  focus: ['clarity', 'speed', 'real use'],
  core: ['events', 'matching', 'apps'],
  enhancements: ['aiDeck', 'analytics'],
  status: 'iterating',
  fuel: ['coffee', 'feedback', 'small wins']
};
```

Good student projects shouldn‚Äôt die because the right sponsor never saw them.

I‚Äôm building the bridge.

*Still shipping. Still learning.*
