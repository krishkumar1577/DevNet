# My 6 AM to 1 AM Developer Routine (And Why It Works)

Everyone asks me: *"How do you find time to code, study, and build projects?"*

Here's my honest breakdown of a typical day — the good, the messy, and the caffeinated.


---

## 🌅 6:00 AM - The Foundation

**Wake up. No snooze button.**

First 30 minutes:
- 🚿 Cold shower (wake up call #1)
- ☕ Coffee (wake up call #2)
- 📖 Read tech news (wake up call #3)

**Why this works**: Starting early gives me 2-3 hours of uninterrupted focus before the world wakes up.


---

## 🏃‍♂️ 6:30 AM - Move or Die

**30-45 minutes of exercise**
- Monday/Wednesday/Friday: Gym
- Tuesday/Thursday: Running
- Weekend: Hiking or cycling

```typescript
const energy = exercise ? "High" : "Crashed by 2 PM";
```

**Real talk**: This isn't negotiable. Code quality = mental clarity = physical health.

## 💻 7:30 AM - Deep Work Block #1

**2.5 hours of pure coding**

This is when I tackle:
- Complex algorithms
- New feature development
- Debugging nasty bugs
- Learning new frameworks

**Rules for deep work**:
- 📱 Phone in another room
- 🔇 Noise-canceling headphones
-  Pomodoro timer (25 min focus, 5 min break)
-  No social media, no exceptions


---

## 📚 10:00 AM - Learning Sprint

**1 hour focused learning**

Current rotation:
- **Mondays**: System Design
- **Tuesdays**: Advanced React patterns
- **Wednesdays**: Backend optimization
- **Thursdays**: DevOps/Docker
- **Fridays**: New tech exploration

**Learning method**:
```javascript
while (confused) {
  buildSomething();
  breakSomething(); 
  fixSomething();
  understanding++;
}
```


---

## 🕐 11:00 AM - University Classes

**4-5 hours of academic work**

Yeah, I'm still a student. Balancing CS coursework with real-world development.

**Pro tip**: I treat university projects as opportunities to experiment with new tech stacks.


---

## 🍔 4:00 PM - Fuel & Decompress

**Lunch + Mental Break**

- Proper meal (not just energy drinks)
- 20-minute walk outside
- Call family/friends
- Zero screen time

**Why this matters**: Your brain needs to reset. Pushing through burnout isn't productive.


---

##  5:00 PM - Deep Work Block #2

**3-4 hours of project development**

This is when I work on:
- Personal projects (like this blog)
- Open source contributions
- Freelance work
- Side hustles

**Current projects**:
- 📝 This MDX blog
- Web extensions
- PulseStack
- AI automation scripts

```typescript
const projects = [
  { name: "DevNet Blog", status: "🚧 In Progress", tech: "Next.js + MDX" },
  { name: "Chrome Extension", status: "⚡ Planning", tech: "React + TypeScript" },
  { name: "PulseStack", status: "🔥 Active", tech: "Full Stack" }
];
```


---

## 🌆 9:00 PM - Community & Content

**1-2 hours of engagement**

- Writing blog posts (like this one)
- Responding to comments
- Twitter/LinkedIn updates
- Discord communities
- Reading other developers' work

**Building in public** isn't just about showing code — it's about building relationships.


---

##  11:00 PM - Wind Down

**1 hour of non-tech reading**

Currently reading: *"Atomic Habits"* by James Clear

**No screens after 11 PM** (mostly successful at this 😅)


---

## 😴 12:00 AM - Sleep

**6 hours of sleep minimum**

Good sleep = better code. Period.


---

## Weekend Adjustments

**Saturdays**: Side projects + socializing  
**Sundays**: Planning next week + lighter coding



---

## What I've Learned

###  What Works:
- **Consistency beats intensity**
- **Time blocking prevents decision fatigue**
- **Physical health = mental performance**
- **Early mornings = gold for focus**

###  What Doesn't Work:
- Coding without breaks
- Skipping exercise
- Perfectionism over progress



---

## The Reality Check

**This isn't every day.**

Some days I oversleep. Some days I skip workouts. Some days I binge Netflix instead of coding.

**The goal isn't perfection — it's consistency.**

If I hit 80% of this routine, I consider it a win.




---

## Your Turn

You don't need to copy my schedule. But ask yourself:

1. **When is your peak focus time?**
2. **What gives you energy vs. drains it?**
3. **How can you build systems, not rely on motivation?**

**Remember**: The best routine is the one you can actually stick to.
